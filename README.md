🎯 Project Overview
This project analyzes credit risk patterns using comprehensive loan default data. The analysis reveals critical insights into risk factors that can help financial institutions make better lending decisions.

"You can not do something that you do not know" - Issa Issa Tchiroma

Key Finding: With a 21.08% default rate, the data reveals alarming patterns that demand immediate attention from any financial institution.
🔍 Key Insights Discovered
🔴 The Debt to Income (DTI) Story: Clear Risk Escalation

Defaults increase dramatically from 455 (Very Low DTI) to 2,186 (Very High DTI)
That's a stunning 4.8x increase - almost 5 times higher!
DTI demonstrates linear risk progression, making it perfect for predictive modeling

🎯 The Credit Utilization Paradox

Moderate utilization segments (10-89%) show consistently high defaults (~1,500-1,600)
Both excellent (<10%) and critical (≥90%) segments have significantly lower defaults (~400)
This suggests different risk dynamics - possibly indicating that extremely high utilization customers are either more carefully managed or represent a different customer profile
